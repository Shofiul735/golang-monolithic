 
# Go Monolithic Project Structure Documentation

This document outlines the structure and organization of our Go monolithic application. The project follows clean architecture principles and standard Go project layout conventions to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Project Root Structure

```
myapp/
├── cmd/
├── internal/
├── pkg/
├── configs/
└── scripts/
```

## Detailed Directory Breakdown

### `cmd/`

**Purpose**: Entry points for the application.

- Contains the main applications for this project
- Each subdirectory should be minimal and only import from internal/ or pkg/
- No business logic should exist here

Example content:
```go
cmd/
└── server/
    └── main.go    // Primary application entry point
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep main.go focused on application setup and initialization
- Handle configuration loading and dependency injection here
- Set up logging, metrics, and other infrastructure concerns
- Initialize and coordinate different parts of the application

### `internal/`

**Purpose**: Private application and library code.

#### `internal/core/`

**Purpose**: Core business logic and domain rules.

- `domain/`: Contains business entity definitions
  - Data structures that represent business objects
  - No dependencies on external packages
  - Pure Go structs with basic validation rules
  - Example: User, Product, Order structs

- `ports/`: Interface definitions for external dependencies
  - Repository interfaces
  - Service interfaces
  - External service adapters
  - Keeps core business logic independent of implementation details

- `services/`: Business logic implementation
  - Implements use cases
  - Orchestrates domain entities
  - Contains business rules and workflows
  - Depends only on domain entities and ports

#### `internal/handlers/`

**Purpose**: HTTP request handlers and route definitions.

- HTTP request/response handling
- Request validation
- Response formatting
- URL routing
- No direct database access
- Should use services for business logic

#### `internal/middleware/`

**Purpose**: HTTP middleware components.

- Authentication/Authorization
- Logging
- Request tracing
- CORS handling
- Rate limiting
- Request/Response modification

#### `internal/repositories/`

**Purpose**: Data access layer implementation.

- Database operations
- Implements repository interfaces defined in core/ports
- SQL queries
- Data mapping between domain entities and database
- Transaction management

#### `internal/platform/`

**Purpose**: Platform-specific implementation details.

- Database connections
- Cache implementations
- Message queue clients
- External service clients
- Infrastructure concerns

### `pkg/`

**Purpose**: Public library code that can be used by external applications.

- Reusable utilities and helpers
- Must be stable and well-tested
- Should have good documentation
- Example: date utilities, string helpers, common middleware

### `configs/`

**Purpose**: Configuration file templates and defaults.

- Configuration file templates
- Default configurations
- Environment-specific configurations
- Schema definitions for configuration

Example content:
```
configs/
├── config.yaml.template
├── development.yaml
├── production.yaml
└── config.go         // Configuration loading logic
```

### `scripts/`

**Purpose**: Scripts for various development operations.

- Build scripts
- Deployment scripts
- Database migration scripts
- Development utilities
- CI/CD scripts

Example content:
```
scripts/
├── build.sh
├── deploy.sh
├── migrate.sh
└── test.sh
```

## Design Principles

### Dependency Rule
- Outer layers can depend on inner layers, but not vice versa
- Domain layer has no external dependencies
- Each layer is protected by interfaces

### Package Guidelines
1. Packages should have a single, focused responsibility
2. Keep packages small and focused
3. Avoid circular dependencies
4. Use meaningful and clear package names
5. Follow standard Go naming conventions

### Code Organization Rules
1. Business logic belongs in `internal/core/services`
2. Database operations belong in `internal/repositories`
3. HTTP handling belongs in `internal/handlers`
4. Infrastructure concerns belong in `internal/platform`
5. Public utilities belong in `pkg`

## Testing Strategy

### Test Location
- Tests should be in the same package as the code they test
- Use `_test.go` suffix for test files
- Integration tests can be in a separate `tests` package

### Test Types
1. Unit Tests: Test individual components
2. Integration Tests: Test component interactions
3. End-to-End Tests: Test complete workflows
4. Performance Tests: Test system performance

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow standard Go project layout
2. Use dependency injection
3. Write idiomatic Go code
4. Document all public APIs
5. Include examples in documentation
6. Write comprehensive tests
7. Use consistent error handling
8. Implement proper logging
9. Follow security best practices

## Version Control

1. Use semantic versioning
2. Maintain a changelog
3. Tag releases
4. Use branch protection rules
5. Require code reviews
6. Run CI/CD pipelines

This structure promotes:
- Clean Architecture principles
- Separation of concerns
- Code reusability
- Maintainability
- Testability
- Scalability
